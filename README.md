# Sales Forecasting Predictive Model

This project presents a time series-based predictive modeling solution designed to forecast future sales trends using historical data. The model incorporates ARIMA and Prophet techniques to generate reliable forecasts that help guide strategic planning and inventory management.

## Case Study: Rab Processors Limited (Malawi)

**Rab Processors Ltd** is one of Malawiâ€™s largest agro-processing and manufacturing companies, producing maize flour, edible oils, packaged rice, beans, and other essential commodities. The company distributes its products nationwide through wholesalers, supermarkets, and retail outlets.

### Business Challenge

Rab Processors faces a common challenge in the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) sector: aligning production and distribution with unpredictable consumer demand. Periods of underproduction or overproduction lead to either stockouts or waste, both of which impact profitability.

With growing demand volatility, Rab Processors needs an intelligent forecasting tool to:
- Predict future sales patterns across product lines.
- Optimize inventory and reduce wastage.
- Align production schedules with market demand.
- Support data-driven decisions in procurement and logistics.

## Solution Overview

This project builds a time series forecasting pipeline to address Rab Processorsâ€™ demand prediction challenge. Two approaches are used:
1. **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**
2. **Prophet (by Facebook) for trend + seasonality modeling**

These models are evaluated for their predictive accuracy, and the best-performing one is recommended for production.

- Streamlit (for optional dashboard)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting-predictive-model.git
   cd sales-forecasting-predictive-model
````

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the pipeline from the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Or, explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to follow the step-by-step analysis.

## Outcomes

* Generates monthly sales forecasts using robust time series techniques.
* Provides metrics to evaluate accuracy of different models.
* Visualizes forecast trends and confidence intervals.
* Offers exportable reports to guide operational decisions.

## Future Enhancements

* Incorporate external factors such as weather and economic indicators.
* Enable real-time data ingestion and dashboard updates.
* Add product-specific models for granular forecasting.
